# Project 1 - Group 8: Analyzing the Relationship Between Crude Oil Prices and Airline Profitability

## Objective

The main objective of our project is to examine the correlation between crude oil prices and airline profitability. We aim to uncover insights into how fluctuations in crude oil prices historically correlate with changes in airline profitability metrics and to understand the operational responses of airlines to significant changes in crude oil prices.

## Approach

We will employ data analysis techniques to explore the relationship between crude oil prices and key financial metrics of airlines. Our approach involves:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathering historical data on crude oil prices and airline profitability metrics and ensuring data integrity through cleaning and preprocessing.
   
2. **Data Analysis**: Conducting statistical analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability.
   
3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations, such as graphs, scattered plots, and charts, to illustrate the correlation between oil prices and airline financial performance.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Cleaning

We will collect historical data on crude oil prices from reliable sources and obtain financial metrics of airlines. Data will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Data Analysis

Statistical techniques will be applied to analyze the relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability metrics. We will determine correlation coefficients and conduct regression analysis to identify patterns and trends.

### Visualization

We will visualize our findings using graphs, scatter plots, and charts to effectively communicate the correlation between crude oil prices and airline financial performance.

## Deliverable

Our project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis report presenting:

- The relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability through data visualization and statistical findings.
- Insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline financial performance.
- Patterns or trends in the impact of crude oil trade price fluctuations on airline profitability.
- Operational responses of airlines to significant changes in crude oil prices and their effects on profitability.
- Identification of other factors affecting the profitability of airlines.

## Questions

Our analysis will address the following questions:

1. How do fluctuations in crude oil prices historically correlate with changes in airline profitability metrics?
2. Can statistical analysis provide insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline financial performance?
3. Are there identifiable patterns or trends in the impact of crude oil trade price fluctuations and airline price fluctuation?
4. How did the individual airlines performed as compared to average profitability of worldwide airlines?
5. What other factors affect the profitability of airlines?
